This project is a platform for a taxi company, which includes admin, driver, and user panels. The goal of this project is to provide an efficient and seamless solution for managing and organizing taxi operations.

Admin Panel
The admin panel provides a centralized interface for managing all aspects of the taxi company, including driver management, dispatch management, and overall company performance. The admin can view driver information, track their location, and assign them to various trips. The admin can also manage the dispatch queue and assign drivers to new trips as they become available.

Driver Panel
The driver panel provides various features for the drivers to carry out their daily operations. After a successful login, the driver can see their current position on the map in real-time and compare it with other taxis in the same location. The driver can see the location of other cars and access the details of completed jobs. A driver's profile feature is also available, which allows them to update their personal information and track their job history. The driver panel integrates with Google Maps to find the quickest route to the pickup and drop-off locations, and there is a job recall feature that allows drivers to accept or decline the job requests. Other features include the ability to mark a job as a no-show, if the rider does not turn up for the scheduled pickup, and the ability to decline a job request.

In conclusion, the driver panel provides a comprehensive solution for the drivers, which enables them to carry out their daily operations with ease.

User Panel
The user panel provides an easy-to-use interface for customers to book trips and view their trip history. Customers can request a ride by specifying their pick-up and drop-off locations, and they will be able to track the status of their ride in real-time. They can also view their past trips and retrieve receipts for expenses.

Technology Stack
This project is built using React Native, which allows for cross-platform development for both Android and iOS. The state management is managed using Redux and Context API , and the project is built using the latest version of the React Native CLI. The project also uses various other libraries and packages, including the React Navigation library for handling navigation within the app and Google APIs for maps and location services.

Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive solution for managing taxi operations and provides a smooth experience for customers, drivers, and administrators alike. Whether you're looking to manage your own taxi company or just want to explore the latest in mobile app development, this project is a great place to start.
